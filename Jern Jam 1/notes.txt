never use unity character controller ever again i wanna kms

Concept:
- time reversal/forward/stop mechanic
- use on objects or self
- time stopped objects can be used as platforms
- can pass through objects but cannot stop when colliding
- when the player dies they can reverse themselves to undo death

Levels:
General ideas:
- elevate yourself using a cube
- drop a cube and then elevate yourself with it
- pause yourself to switch moving platforms
- reverse yourself/cube to cross back over a new gap or closed door
- reverse own death
- visit parts of your own/cube history backwards to unlock something one by one
- alternate reversing platforms to zigzag between walls over a gap
- reverse yourself and pause so you have line of sight to an object

1. Prologue
- Prologue (optional)
	- spawn in a passage
	- leads to a room with a big entrance in front and a side passage
	- when you enter the room, a boulder rolls in and blocks big entrance
	- enter side passage, see time control watch
	- when you pick it up, ceiling caves in and crushes you
	- use time control on yourself to unsmoosh yourself
- Crumbled bridge - reverse to repair
- Crumbled ceiling - reverse and stop to make platform
- Broken elevator going down - reverse to get in, forward to descend
	- if you release too early you die of fall damage
2. Cube Riding
- Cube falls, reverse cube to ride it up
- Drop cube, then reverse to ride it up
- Pause cube to cross gap
3. Doors Intro
- Cube and button open door
- Move cubes over row of buttons and reverse one by one to open row of doors
4. Pause Intro
- Player pause themselves, moving platforms switch underneath
- Same with cube to open door at the end
5. Doors Phasing
- Cube pass through door
	- Fetch a cube from a previous room by taking a cube from the next room, replacing the old cube with it, then rewinding the new cube
- Player pass through door
- add side window room so you can't get stuck?
	- see if you can cheese
	- cube spawner is probably better
cancelled level.
- Player reverses themselves through a door and pause themselves so they have line of sight to an object to time control it

Pick up/time control booleans:
x Can't pick up twice (_objectGrabbable null or not)
x Can't time control twice (_objectTimeControllable null or not)
x Can't time control while picking up (timeControl.canTimeControl)
x Can't pick up while time controlling (pickUpDrop.canPickUp)
x Object can't be picked up while being time controlled (canPickUp)

Time control UI:
x Crosshair changes based on what you're looking at
	x Nothing
	x Time controllable
	x Paused
	- Time controlling (red blinking?)
	- (optional) picking up item
x Bar appears for object's history
x Bar for player history
x Pause button for player paused
x highlight current object through walls
x show path through walls when hovering

Sounds:
x Cube grab sound
x Button press/unpress sound (manual too)
x Door open/close sound
x Exit sound
x Time controlling sounds
	x Controlling
	x Pause
	x Release
x Landslide sounds
	x for boulder, watch get event, bridge events
x Fall damage sound
- Acquiring time control sounds

Todo:
do now/finished
x Figure out how to make levels
x Make a test level with a cube
x Implement carrying around cube
x Implement time control with cube
x figure out can pick up/can time control booleans
x make it so can't drop objects when intersecting with player
x set velocities = 0 while controlling, disable colliders? or make kinematic
x implement pause
x Implement time control with player
x Time control UI
x test object penetrating corners when corners overlapping
x finish base 4 levels
- make prologue level
	x figure out how to make natural looking cave level texture/model
	x decide between bridge/boulder
		x bridge:
			x natural or sci-fi bridge
			x how to make crumbling look natural
		x boulders and smaller rocks
		- screen shake
	- time control watch power-up
		- landslide event
	x crumbled ceiling
	- elevator
		- player death when falling too far (reversible)
	x facility entrance
	

do at some point
- Show move controls at first level
x Controls UI
x Fix door sound playing at start
x Pick up cube while time controlling and time controlling cube while holding
- Handle pinching
	- Death on pinch
	- OR make collider on pinch
	- OR move aside on pinch
	- OR do something with rigidbodies idk
x Fix player not clipping through moving platforms
x Fix cube trailing behind on moving platforms
x Allow player to drop cube closer
x Add delay at endpoints for moving platforms

optional
- Add trigger to bridge pit to highlight reverse self? Or just make stairs
- Fix cube not being able to be lifted when moving up on moving platform
- Fix cube not rotating sometimes
- Increase stairs climb speed
- Make exit particles look better
- Fix cube jiggling at corners
- Give option to turn off paths
- Handle running out of memory for history
- Disable time control release when inside an object?
- Smooth time control using lerp/slerp
- Textures?
- First person viewpoint stuff?

never do:
- move along with time controlled cubes you're standing on
	-wtf???
	-cancelled
